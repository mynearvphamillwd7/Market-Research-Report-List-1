<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turbine Inlet Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inlet Fogging</li><li>Chiller System</li><li>Evaporative Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Turbine Inlet Cooling System market comprises three primary types: inlet fogging, chiller systems, and evaporative cooling. Inlet fogging involves spraying water into the incoming air to reduce its temperature and increase air density, enhancing turbine efficiency. Chiller systems use mechanical refrigeration to cool the air before it enters the turbine. Evaporative cooling leverages the natural cooling effect of water evaporation to lower air temperature. Each method aims to improve power generation performance and efficiency in gas turbines.</p></p>
